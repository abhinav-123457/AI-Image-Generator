## Description

This project utilizes Stable Diffusion models to generate high-quality images. The Stable Diffusion technique gradually refines images by iteratively adding noise to the input, resulting in visually appealing outputs. This repository provides code for setting up, running, and customizing the image generation process.

## Features

- **Image Generation**: Utilize Stable Diffusion models to generate diverse and high-quality images.
- **Customization**: Adjust parameters to control the style and content of generated images..
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation and examples to help users get started and customize the project.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11
- PyTorch
- Stable Diffuser
- Pillow
- Other dependencies as listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhinav-123457/AI-Image-Generator.git
   cd image_ai.py
2. Run the .py file and generate your images üòäüòÅ


## Other way of using the ai 

1. Go to "Google Collab" and create a notebook.
2. Change the runtime to "T4 GPU"
3. Copy the code and paste the code in code box.
